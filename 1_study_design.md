Many aspects of the study design will depend on conversations with the customer, but we can make reasonable assumptions to begin the discussion.

## Scope
We will track five common staple foods in Zimbabwe: <strong>maize, rice, fresh milk, chicken and beef</strong>.

These may represent more than five SKUs, for example milk is often sold in 100 and 250ml plastic bags, and in bulk. Unless the client is interested in this level of detail we will need to report a normalized price, e.g. in USD/liter. This may involve enumerator training, carefully wording data collection assignments, and manual or automated post-processing of enumerator submissions.

The prices of each food item will be tracked in five major cities:

<div class="list-with-map">
  <div class="list">
    <ol>
      <li>Harare</li>
      <li>Bulawayo</li>
      <li>Chitungwiza</li>
      <li>Mutare</li>
      <li>Gweru</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <div class="map">
    <div id="citymap-container" style="position: relative; height: 300px; width: 100%;"></div>
  </div>
</div>

We will initially focus on urban and peri-urban areas for ease of enumerator recruitment and to maximize the likelihood of mobile connectivity. Once the network is established in Zimbabwe we can consider expanding into rural areas through partnerships or referrals.

## Data volume and frequency
We will target 40 high quality observations per product per month in each of the five cities, i.e. 200 monthly observations per location. If we assume that only 60% of submitted observations are usable quality, we will need to assign about 335 data collection tasks per month in each city. The tasks will initially be assigned weekly to monitor data quality and possibly identify intra-month price variations, e.g. around pay periods. The fraction of high quality reports will likely increase over time.

It will be important adjust the size of the network and availability of tasks to match enumerators’ expectations around level of effort and earning potential. With only 335 tasks per month, we might target 10 active enumerators in each city to start, and then adjust our recruiting efforts as we learn more about enumerators’ submission frequency and typical level of effort. We will eventually need to undertake higher volume projects to make maintenance of a network in Zimbabwe compelling for enumerators and for Premise.

## Task design
Data collection tasks assigned to enumerators should be simple and unambiguous. Ideally tasks will require minimal training and be accessible to anyone with basic literacy and numeracy skills. Considerations to discuss with the customer include:

* Is there a preference for packaged vs. bulk goods, and are these tracked separately?
* Is there a preference for data from formal retailers vs. local markets?
* Are there important distinctions around product quality or variants, eg. maize varieties, cuts of meat or grades of rice?
* Is verbal confirmation of a price sufficient, or is a photo of a written sign or receipt required? With time Premise can help answer this question quantitatively.

In general we will prefer highly specified tasks. For example “Take a picture of a 250ml bag of milk at Pick n Pay Westgate, that also shows the price on the shelf” is preferable to “How much does a liter of milk cost in Harare”.
