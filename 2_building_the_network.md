## Recruitment channels and messaging
Our main recruiting channel will be geographically targeted Facebook<sup><a href="#notes">1</a></sup> ads, supplemented by other approaches as needed. We will place ads in target cities with straightforward messaging, e.g. “Earn money with part-time work you can do from your phone”. These ads will initially be in English but we may test Shona or Ndebele translations.

Facebook is widely used in Zimbabwe and may be sufficient on its own, but higher touch approaches can be employed if needed. An in-app referral program with appropriate bonuses may be useful to grow the network quickly, and local job boards may help us expand our reach beyond Facebook users.<sup><a href="#notes">2</a></sup> Community savings groups are common in rural Zimbabwe, and it may be possible to engage them via partnerships with NGOs, microfinance institutions or faith-based organizations. Combining these approaches could help Premise reach remote areas that are expensive for traditional data collection organizations to cover.

## Enumerator compensation and payout
Our compensation plan will be designed to provide transparent, timely payouts that are appropriate for the task and market. Each data collection task will be assigned a point value, and enumerators will earn points once submitted tasks are approved by Premise. Points will be redeemable in fixed-size blocks (see below) for mobile money top-up or phone credit, with individual tasks initially worth USD 0.10-0.20.

Premise will integrate with a mobile money and airtime gateway that has reach in Zimbabwe. Gateways such as [Transfer To](http://www.transfer-to.com) allow users to fund an account with dollars and then send mobile money and airtime to phones on selected carriers.<sup><a href="#notes">3</a></sup> Transfers can be made manually via the web or through their API. Gateways charge a markup on the amount transferred and sometimes only support specific fixed transaction sizes, hence the need to require enumerators to earn blocks of points before cashing out. Once our network is established in Zimbabwe we may consider establishing bulk payment accounts directly with mobile operators, but this takes time and requires a local business entity. The convenience of gateways is worth the inflexibility and higher cost in the short term.

## Onboarding, training and support
The process of qualifying, onboarding and supporting new enumerators will be automated as much as possible. Facebook ads will direct users to a qualification questionnaire that includes basic demographic questions and information about the opportunity, with qualifying applicants placed in a queue.

Qualified applicants will be contacted to begin training as needed. They will receive training materials via the web or our app that describe the role and compensation plan, and give examples of correct and incorrect data capture. The applicant will be required to pass a brief quiz before being invited to complete a series of paid training tasks. Training tasks will be designed to make sure the applicant can follow instructions, has a phone with working camera and GPS, and is not submitting obviously fake information. For example, they may be asked to take a picture of a well known landmark, or collect price and location information that we already know with a high degree of confidence.

Applicants who complete the process will begin work as enumerators as tasks become available. They will be invited to a private Facebook group for their local network, and given a WhatsApp number monitored by the Growth Team for urgent inquiries. These channels will give enumerators a forum for clarifying tasks and resolving technology and payment issues. We will also monitor social media and the Google Play store for indirect feedback from enumerators.

## Regulatory and cultural environment
It is important to be aware of legal and cultural context to ensure the safety of our enumerators and Premise’s ongoing presence in Zimbabwe. In additon to national labor laws there are several recent ICT policy developments that should be tracked closely.

Zimbabwe’s labor law allows for non-contract “casual” employment for individuals employed for less than 6 weeks at a time. It will be important to structure our messaging and recruiting with this limitation in mind, unless we reach a point where longer term contract employees are needed. Long term reliance on casual labor has sometimes been [viewed as exploitative](https://www.newsday.co.zw/2014/08/13/zims-casualisation-labour-leads-new-form-exploitation/), so we must clearly communicate our expectations and compensation plan.

The legal framework around technology and communication in Zimbabwe is in its nascent stages. Three bills introduced in 2015 may be especially relevant to Premise: 

* [e-Transactions Bill](http://www.techzim.co.zw/2015/09/as-parliament-tables-e-transactions-bill-heres-how-it-will-benefit-zimbabweans/) &mdash; includes clauses that address online marketing and electronic payments
* [Cybercrime Bill](http://www.techzim.co.zw/2015/10/child-porn-spam-everything-illegal-under-zimbabwes-draft-cybercrime-bill/) &mdash; references “data espionage” and “illegal data interference”
* [Data Protection Bill](http://www.techzim.co.zw/2015/11/understanding-zimbabwes-draft-data-protection-bill/) &mdash; governs collection of personally identifiable information, “sensitive data”, and establishes a Data Protection Authority of Zimbabwe

It is not yet clear how or when the new regulations will be enforced, or how they will impact Premise operating as a US-based organization. We should monitor them closely and be sensitive to concerns from enumerators.
