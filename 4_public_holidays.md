title: Public holidays

From time to time public holidays may interfere with data collection. The roll-out period of of this project includes a week-long holiday during which data collection may be difficult. 

The holiday may not present a problem. For many organizations operating in emerging markets a week is not a meaningful delay, and the customerâ€™s schedule may be able to accommodate the delay. Over time we may find that our network continues to operate during public holidays if they are well incentivized.

That said, we could adjust our tactics if the customer is on a tight schedule, or has specific interest in the holiday's impact on food prices:

* Schedule most of our data collection tasks before the holiday
* Temporarily increase our compensation per task
* Reach out to enumerators directly over Facebook or WhatsApp to request data during the holiday period
