---

Premiseâ€™s platform allows us to measure almost every aspect of the data collection pipleine, from enumerator recruitment to the overall success of our campaign. The following metrics will be especially important to monitor as we quickly build a robust network:

* Rate of eligible enumerator applications per city
* Number of active enumerators per city
* Time between task assignment and completion
* Rejection rate per task
* Effective enumerator compensation rate

This list is not exhaustive but will help us tune key aspects of recruitment, task selection, data collection rate and budget.
