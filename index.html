<h1 id="intro-label">Introduction</h1>
<p>A customer has approached Premise with a request to track the prices of five food items in Zimbabwe. This document outlines a strategy to translate the customerâ€™s high level request into a well-scoped data collection task, and engage a new team of freelance enumerators on our platform.</p>

<h3>60 day plan</h3>
<p>Over an eight week roll-out Premise will work with the customer to specify the data collection task. We will agree on which products to track, and the geography, volume, frequency and duration of data collection. We will develop metrics to measure the success of the campaign, monitor progress, and adjust the campaign as needed.</p>

<p>In parallel with the study design Premise will begin to engage enumerators. Recruitment will take place initially via targeted Facebook ads, and later through partnerships (e.g. with community savings organizations) if needed. Applicants who pass a qualification questionnaire will receive training materials electronically, and need to complete a series of training assignments before being approved for work.</p>

<p>Successful enumerators will receive data collection assignments weekly and be paid via mobile money or airtime topup. Premise will monitor the political and regulatory environment on an ongoing basis to ensure the safety of our enumerators and business in Zimbabwe.</p>
